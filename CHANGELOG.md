# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Client-Side SDK for Node.js will be documented in this file.

### Added:
- The SDK now logs a message at `info` level when the stream connection is started or stopped. It also logs a message at `warn` level if it detects that the stream had to be restarted due to a connection failure.
 
### Fixed:
- The SDK failed to restart a streaming connection if it had already been dropped and restarted before.
